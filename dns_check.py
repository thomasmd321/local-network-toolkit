"""Check for DNS hijacking: a resolver answering for a domain that shouldn't exist.

Every other tool here assumes your network's DNS answers can be trusted -
exposure_check.py resolves nothing itself, and even upnp_audit.py/
mdns_browser.py work at the IP level. But a compromised router, a
malicious/free Wi-Fi hotspot, or a captive portal all commonly do the same
thing: intercept DNS and answer with their own IP for domains that should
NXDOMAIN (no such domain), redirecting you to an ad page, a phishing page,
or a "please log in" portal before you've even opened a browser. Nothing
else in this project would notice - a scan sees devices and open ports,
not whether the network is lying to you about DNS.

Two checks, run against your system's own configured resolver (whatever
it's actually using - /etc/resolv.conf, DHCP-provided DNS, or a platform's
own network settings, all covered identically since this asks the OS to
resolve it rather than reading that configuration itself) and against a
small set of known-good public resolvers:

1. THE DECISIVE ONE - NXDOMAIN hijacking: query a freshly random hostname
   under the ".invalid" TLD, which RFC 2606 reserves specifically so it
   can never be a real registered domain. Any answer at all for it - from
   your resolver or a public one - means something is intercepting
   NXDOMAIN responses and fabricating an answer. This is nearly always
   deliberate interception, not a false positive.

2. A SOFTER, CAVEATED ONE - cross-resolver comparison: resolve
   example.com (also reserved by RFC 2606, specifically for stable
   documentation/testing use, unlike almost every other domain which may
   be legitimately answered differently per resolver via CDN/anycast
   geo-routing) against your resolver and each public one, and report a
   mismatch. Unlike check 1, a mismatch here is a *softer* signal - see
   the caveat this prints on every run.

The public resolvers are queried directly with a hand-built, from-scratch
DNS client over raw UDP sockets (stdlib only: socket + struct), since
Python's standard library has no way to target a *specific* resolver
address - socket.getaddrinfo()/gethostbyname() always go through whatever
the OS itself is configured to use, which is exactly what's needed for
"my configured resolver" but useless for "what does 1.1.1.1 say". The
wire-format name encoding/decoding (_encode_dns_name/_decode_dns_name) is
duplicated from mobile_network_scanner.py/mdns_browser.py rather than
imported - see this project's README for why each script here stays
independently self-contained - and extended here with real compression-
pointer following in answer records plus response validation (matching
transaction ID) that those mDNS-only versions didn't need, since mDNS
correlates replies by name over a shared multicast channel rather than by
a real request/response pairing to one specific server.

Usage:
    python dns_check.py                       # both checks, default public resolvers
    python dns_check.py --resolver 1.1.1.1 --resolver 9.9.9.9
    python dns_check.py --timeout 5 --output dns_check.json
    python dns_check.py --no-color

Verified about as thoroughly as a tool here can be: query_resolver()'s
wire-format build/parse code is exercised for real against a small fake
UDP DNS server run locally in test_dns_check.py (a genuine, unmocked
socket end-to-end test, including a compressed name in the answer
record and a rejected mismatched-transaction-ID reply) - and, unlike this
project's HTTPS-based tools (exposure_check.py's api.ipify.org call,
blocked by this sandbox's outbound HTTP proxy), raw UDP port 53 traffic
isn't proxied here, so a real run against the actual internet-facing
Cloudflare/Google/Quad9 resolvers worked end to end too: all three (and
the local resolver) correctly returned NXDOMAIN for a fresh canary, and
all three agreed with the local resolver's real example.com answer.
That's every code path in this module exercised for real - the only
thing genuinely untested is a *live* DNS-hijacking network to confirm a
positive result looks right, which by definition isn't something to go
looking for.
