"""List nearby Wi-Fi networks: SSID, channel, signal, and security.

Complements network_scanner.py/mobile_network_scanner.py rather than
overlapping with them: those two find *devices already on your network*;
this finds *networks in radio range*, including ones you're not connected
to. "Why does my network feel slow" is often channel congestion from a
neighbor's network on the same channel, or a weak signal, neither of which
device discovery can see at all - this is a different, complementary
question.

Shells out to the OS's own Wi-Fi tooling rather than using a raw 802.11
library (no cross-platform one ships in the standard library, and the
alternative - a packet-capture-based scanner - needs monitor mode and
root/administrator on every platform, a much higher bar than this needs):
    - Linux: `nmcli -t -f SSID,BSSID,CHAN,SIGNAL,SECURITY dev wifi list`
      (NetworkManager's own CLI; nmcli's terse `-t` output escapes literal
      colons within a field, e.g. inside a BSSID, with a backslash - see
      _parse_nmcli_line()).
    - macOS: the `airport` command-line tool (Apple marked it "deprecated"
      years ago but it's still present and functional as of this writing;
      see _AIRPORT_PATH). Its columnar text output doesn't reliably
      delimit the SSID column when a name has spaces, so parsing locates
      the BSSID (a MAC address) as an anchor and splits around it instead
      - see _parse_airport_line().
    - Windows: `netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid` (a stable, long
      documented format: indented "SSID N :"/"Authentication :" blocks,
      each followed by one or more "BSSID N :" sub-blocks with their own
      Signal/Channel lines).

Signal strength is reported in whatever unit each platform's own tool
uses - a percentage on Linux/Windows, dBm (RSSI) on macOS - and is kept
as-is (e.g. "78%", "-55 dBm") rather than converted between them: dBm and
"percent" don't have one true conversion (it's vendor/driver-specific), so
pretending to unify them would be less honest than just labeling each.

Usage:
    python wifi_scanner.py
    python wifi_scanner.py --timeout 15
    python wifi_scanner.py --output networks.json
    python wifi_scanner.py --no-color

Known limitation, stated plainly: this sandbox has none of nmcli, airport,
or netsh installed, and no Wi-Fi hardware to scan with even if it did - so
every platform's parser here is verified only against mocked subprocess
output matching each tool's documented format (see test_wifi_scanner.py),
never against a real device on real hardware. Treat a first run on any
platform as the actual verification it hasn't had yet, and please report
back (or send a patch) if a given OS/tool version's real output doesn't
match what's parsed here.

Also compares each scan against a small local registry of previously seen
networks (~/.cache/wifi_scanner_known_networks.json, the same
persisted-between-runs spirit as network_scanner.py's known-devices
registry) to flag two evil-twin/rogue-AP patterns: a familiar SSID
suddenly answering with *weaker* security than it's ever shown before (a
classic downgrade attack - a legitimate AP doesn't just drop encryption on
its own), and a familiar SSID answering from a BSSID never seen before
(a softer signal - could be a genuinely new/roaming AP on a mesh or
enterprise network with many legitimate access points sharing one SSID,
so this is flagged for a second look, not treated as proof). See
_find_evil_twin_candidates(). --no-evil-twin-check skips this entirely;
--forget-known-networks clears the registry. The evil-twin logic itself
is unit-tested with plain dicts (no subprocess/hardware involved at all),
and was also run for real end-to-end against a fake nmcli script on PATH:
a baseline WPA2 scan, an unchanged repeat (correctly silent), then a
simulated downgrade to Open on the same BSSID (correctly flagged) and a
new BSSID appearing under the same SSID (also correctly flagged, as
"new_bssid" rather than "security_downgrade" once security itself hadn't
weakened) - the full scan -> compare -> update-registry -> persist
pipeline, exercised for real.
