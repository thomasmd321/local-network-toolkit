"""Discover devices on the local network.

Uses an ARP scan via scapy when available (fast, returns MAC addresses
directly). Falls back to a multithreaded ping sweep plus the system ARP
table when scapy isn't installed or the process lacks the privileges
ARP scanning requires.

Any device still missing a hostname after that gets a second pass: mDNS/
Bonjour reverse lookup, then DNS-SD Cast service discovery for anything
that looks like it might be a Chromecast (see mdns_reverse_lookup() and
mdns_service_lookup()). Devices with a MAC address also get it looked up
against the IEEE's public OUI registry to identify the manufacturer
(see lookup_mac_vendor()) - this is unlike mobile_network_scanner.py's
iOS target, which can't do any of this due to Apple's sandboxing of
raw-socket multicast traffic; desktop/Termux environments have no such
restriction.

Every scan is also compared against a small local registry of previously
seen devices (see _mark_new_devices()), so a device that's never shown up
before gets flagged "NEW" in the results table. Pair this with --watch to
turn a one-shot scan into a lightweight "alert me when something joins my
network" monitor.

Usage:
    python network_scanner.py                     # auto-detect local subnet
    python network_scanner.py 192.168.1.0/24       # scan a specific subnet
    python network_scanner.py 192.168.1.0/24,10.0.0.0/24  # scan several subnets
    python network_scanner.py --all-subnets        # scan every subnet this
                                                    # machine has an interface
