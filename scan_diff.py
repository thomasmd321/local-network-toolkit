"""Compare two saved scans and report what changed between them.

network_scanner.py and mobile_network_scanner.py can each save a scan's
results to a file with --output (see export_results() in either one) -
this script takes two of those files and reports which devices were
added, which disappeared, and which changed (a different port, a new
banner, a changed hostname, etc.), the same way the scanners' own
NEW/CHG/missing markers work against the known-devices registry, just
applied to two snapshots on disk instead of "registry vs. this scan".

The two files don't need to come from the same script, or even use the
same format - JSON and CSV (whichever --output produced) both work, and
either side can be either format. Fields the two scripts don't share
(mac/vendor are desktop-only, banner is mobile-only) are compared too,
whenever both files happen to have them, without either script needing
to know about the other's schema.

A device is matched across the two files by MAC address if it has one
(surviving a DHCP lease change), falling back to IP otherwise - the same
identity rule network_scanner.py's own known-devices tracking uses (see
its _device_identity()). mobile_network_scanner.py's exports have no MAC
at all, so its devices are always matched by IP, with the same caveat
its own registry has: a changed IP looks like two different devices.

    python scan_diff.py before.csv after.csv
