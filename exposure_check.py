"""Check whether ports open on your LAN are also reachable from the internet.

network_scanner.py/mobile_network_scanner.py's RISKY_PORTS check flags a
port as worth a second look purely from inside the LAN - but a risky port
reachable only from your own network (telnet on a printer nobody outside
the house can reach) is a much smaller problem than the same port reachable
from the entire internet. This asks the second, sharper question: probing
your own public/WAN IP address, from this machine, for exactly the ports
RISKY_PORTS already flags (or any --ports you name instead).

How the public IP is found: a single plain HTTP(S) GET to
https://api.ipify.org - a small, purpose-built, widely used "what's my IP"
echo service (no account, no API key, returns just the address as plain
text). No other data about your network is sent anywhere; --ip skips this
entirely if you'd rather not make that request, or already know the address.

READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING A RESULT: probing your own public IP from inside
your own LAN is not a reliable substitute for a real external scan. Most
home routers implement "NAT loopback"/"hairpin NAT" inconsistently:
    - Some routers silently drop this traffic entirely, so a genuinely
      OPEN port reports as unreachable here - a false "closed".
    - Some routers loop the connection back to a LAN device without ever
      routing it out to the internet and back, so a "reachable" result
      here doesn't prove an actual outside host could reach it either -
      a false "open".
A CLOSED result here is therefore never proof of safety, and an OPEN
result is never definitive proof of exposure - both need confirming from
a real external vantage point (a VPS, a friend's network, a phone on
cellular data with Wi-Fi off, or a third-party online port-checking site
you choose and visit yourself) before you act on it either way. This tool
is a cheap first pass, not the final word.

Usage:
    python exposure_check.py                        # RISKY_PORTS, auto-detected public IP
    python exposure_check.py --ports 22,80,443,8080
    python exposure_check.py --ip 203.0.113.5 --ports 22
    python exposure_check.py --output exposure.json
    python exposure_check.py --no-color
