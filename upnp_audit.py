"""List every port your router's UPnP has silently opened to the internet.

exposure_check.py answers "is this port reachable from outside" after the
fact, by probing your public IP. This answers a sharper, earlier question:
*why* a port might be open at all, even though nothing in this LAN's own
scan results looks unusual. Many home routers ship with UPnP (Universal
Plug and Play) enabled, letting any device on the network ask the router to
forward a port from the internet straight to itself - a game console, a
BitTorrent client, a smart-home hub - with no further confirmation and no
trace visible from LAN-side scanning at all. This queries the router
itself for its current UPnP port-mapping table, the same information a
malicious LAN device could have used to open that port in the first place.

Protocol, in order:
    1. SSDP discovery - an M-SEARCH multicast UDP query to 239.255.255.250:
       1900, the standard way anything on a LAN finds a UPnP Internet
       Gateway Device (the same request/response shape mDNS/DNS-SD's
       "meta-query" idea is built on, just an older, HTTP-header-flavored
       sibling protocol rather than DNS's wire format).
    2. Fetch the device's XML description from the LOCATION URL the SSDP
       response points to, and find its WANIPConnection or
       WANPPPConnection service - the ones that actually manage port
       forwarding - by walking the XML rather than assuming any one
       nesting depth, since routers vary here.
    3. Call that service's GetGenericPortMappingEntry SOAP action once per
       index (0, 1, 2, ...) until the router reports there are no more -
       a normal SOAP fault (usually error 713), not a real failure.

Usage:
    python upnp_audit.py
    python upnp_audit.py --timeout 5
    python upnp_audit.py --output mappings.json
    python upnp_audit.py --no-color

Known limitation, stated plainly: this project's own development
environment has no reachable UPnP Internet Gateway Device to discover -
the full SSDP -> XML -> SOAP pipeline is verified with a real, unmocked
gateway simulated locally (a genuine SSDP responder plus a genuine HTTP
server serving real XML/SOAP bodies, all communicating over real sockets -
see test_upnp_audit.py), which exercises every wire-format detail this
script actually depends on, but it has never spoken to a real router.
Router UPnP stacks are inconsistent about spec compliance in ways a
simulated one won't reproduce; treat a first real run as the verification
it hasn't had yet, and please report back if your router's real responses
don't parse the way this expects.
